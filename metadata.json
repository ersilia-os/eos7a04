    "Description": "Low dimension continuous descriptor based on a neural machine translation model. This model has been trained by inputting a IUPAC molecular representation to obtain its SMILES. The intermediate continuous vector representation encoded by when reading the IUPAC name is a representation of the molecule, containing all the information to generate the output sequence (SMILES). This model has been pretrained on a large dataset combining ChEMBL and ZINC.\n",
